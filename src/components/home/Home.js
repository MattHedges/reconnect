<h2 className="section_title">Mission Statement</h2>

<div className="home_content">
    The idea of Reconnect came from the adage "there are other people going through the same things as you." So we decided to take that adage and turn it into a place where anyone struggling can come to speak about their experiences, and try to learn from others. Our goal is to educate our community on their diagnosis and help them live happy, fulfilling lives. Everyday can be a struggle especially whenever you feel disconnected from the world around you, but we will help Reconnect you with yourself and others around you to start the healing process. Sometimes figuring out where to start can be the hardest, so we hope that our community can help you figure out your first steps to a new you.
